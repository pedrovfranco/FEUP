\subsection{Software engineering}

The application of a \textbf{systematic}, \textbf{disciplined},
\textbf{quantifiable} approach to the development, operation, and
maintenance of software; that is, the application of
engineering to software.

    \item Software Design
    \item Software Construction
    \item Software Testing
    \item Software Maintenance
\end{itemize}

          radiation caused by a software error (race condition)


    \item Ariane 5 Explosion (1996)

          10 years of development and 7 billion lost in an
          explosion due to a software error (overflow)
\end{itemize}
